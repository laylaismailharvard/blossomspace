To run: Type Flask Run in the command line of the integrated terminal. Make sure to have Python 3.7+ and install the required dependencies (pip install Flask Flask-Login Werkzeug)
How to interact: If the user is not signed in or registered with Blossom Space, they will only be allowed to view posts, search, and view user's profiles. Once a user is signed in and registered, they will be able to save posts, create and delete their own posts, and make their own profile with name and bio.

Functions: To delete their own post, a user must be logged in and they have to click on the post (whether from the homepage or their own profile), and then click the delete button. To save a post, they must click the 'Save Post' button and they can only save a post once. To see the post a user has saved, they can click on the bookmark to get to the Saved Posts page. To search, which is something they can do without logging in, you must input a value into the search bar in the top right corner, and a list of what you have searched will be highlighted.
